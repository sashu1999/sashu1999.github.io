        <p>
          I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Industrial Engineering with a specialization in Advanced Analytics at the University of Illinois - Urbana-Champaign. My academic journey, combined with hands-on experience, has equipped me with a strong foundation in data-driven decision-making and advanced analytical techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a Research Assistant at the <a class="text-link" href="https://www.inhs.illinois.edu/">Illinois Natural History Survey</a>, I implemented a Document Layout Analysis application utilizing Pytorch, OpenCV, and AWS Textract. This application automated the parsing and analysis of PDF reports for multiple species, generating and processing over 50 comprehensive reports for stakeholders.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my Data Science Internship at the Illinois Natural History Survey, I created an AWS-powered pipeline, significantly streamlining the digitization of historical survey data. My work processed over 100 datasheets with precision and efficiency, reducing manual effort and time.
        </p>
        <p>
          My previous experience as a Software Engineer at <a class="text-link" href="https://www.caterpillar.com/">Caterpillar Inc.</a> allowed me to develop cutting-edge solutions, including a real-time Automated Marker-Band Seam Tracking system and various features for fleet management and battery services, which improved operational efficiency and reduced costs.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am proficient in programming languages such as Python, R, and Java, with a strong emphasis on data science and machine learning. I have utilized frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-Learn to build and deploy predictive models and data-driven applications. My experience extends to working with large-scale data processing tools like Spark and Hadoop, enabling me to manage and analyze vast datasets efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
          My expertise in cloud platforms, including AWS and Azure, has allowed me to design and implement end-to-end data pipelines, leveraging services such as S3, EC2, and RDS for scalable and secure data storage and processing. I am also well-versed in DevOps practices and MLOPS practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          My passion for data science and analytics drives me to continuously explore new methodologies and tools. I am actively contributing to open-source projects, particularly in the exciting realm of machine learning and data engineering, and I’m eager to expand my impact in this field.
